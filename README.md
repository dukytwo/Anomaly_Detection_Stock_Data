# CS109B_Project_Anomaly_Detection
We have implemented a martingale-based concept change detection method and applied it to a multi-dimensional dataset with Microsoft stock price and other variables describing the state of the company and the economy.  We have successfully detected anomalies (concept changes) in online mode using past 120 and 360 days of our data and manually validated them.
